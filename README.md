# DeepLearning Learning Scripts

## Implemented some stuff for fun:

 - **tf_MNIST.py**: ConvNet on MNIST data using Tensorflow.
 - **Stacking.R**: Built a Stacking learner for breast cancer prediction  by ensembling logistic regression, random forest and naive bayes to improve accuracy
 - **AutoEncoder.R**: Built a simple denoise Autoencoder using Tensorflow
