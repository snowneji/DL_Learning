# Daily Learning 

## Implementing some stuff for fun:

 
 - **AutoEncoder.R**: Built a simple denoise Autoencoder using Tensorflow
 - **Stacking.R**: Built a Stacking learner for breast cancer prediction  by ensembling logistic regression, random forest and naive bayes
 - **tf_MNIST.py**: ConvNet on MNIST data using Tensorflow.
 - **LSTM.ipynb.py**: LSTM Time Series Forecasting using Keras
 - **Arima_n_Prophet_Forecasting**: Time Series Forecasting using ARIMA, Prophet and their blend
